## Nomi Vos

I am a strong believer in lifelong learning and discovering new things. I have a curious nature and am interested in way too many things to learn in one lifetime. I am methodical with a strong attention to detail and have a good eye for design, both in styling and in the code itself.

## Skills

#### I work well with other people

I am comfortable working with other people and on teams.  During my time at Makers Academy I worked on a remote cohort with people from 10 different countries with different cultures, backgrounds and native languages.  Every day we pair programmed with different people.  I also worked on 3 different team projects each with different team members. I was successfully able to adapt to the unique dynamics posed by each team.  In one case I became the mediator in the group to smooth tensions created by conflicting opinions.

#### I am self-motivated

Prior to Makers I ran 2 businesses of my own part-time. In both my quilting and photography businesses, I taught myself the skills necessary to run the businesses.  I learned how to use a quilting machine and how to make my own quilting designs. I improved upon my photography and learned Photoshop and retouching. I gained knowledge about online marketing and how to have an online presence. I learned the business/financial part of running your own business. I worked with customers and strived to keep them happy. I juggled home life with customer dead-lines.
