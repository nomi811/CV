I am located in the heart of the Midwest in the United States. I am a stay-at-home homeschool entrepreneur mom of 8 kids turned Web Developer via Makers Academy in London, England.

Starting from ground zero, I taught myself enough Ruby to join the ranks of the 10% accepted into Makers Academy.

 *"It's not called "Oxbridge meets the Marines, but for Developers" for nothing!"* - [Makers Academy website](http://www.makersacademy.com)

 I can claim the distinction of never being late or absent for the 3:30am (US time) start time during the whole 3 months of the remote online bootcamp.

 I am a strong believer in lifelong learning, discovering new things, and being open to possibilities. I have a curious nature and am interested in *~ way ~* too many things to learn in one lifetime.

#### Work well with other people

I am comfortable working with other people and on teams.  During my time at Makers Academy I worked on a remote cohort with people from 10 different countries, who had different cultures, backgrounds and native languages.  Every day was a new pair programming experience.  I also worked on 3 different team projects each with new team members. I was successfully able to adapt to the unique dynamics posed by each team or pair partner.  At times I stepped up and filled the mediator role of the team to smooth tensions created by conflicting opinions.

I also have experience working with people in various customer service roles.  I worked with many customers with my quilting business. I helped elderly people with their daily living needs as a Certified Nurse Assistant. As an Administrative Assistant, I helped both the staff and congregation with a variety of needs. Also,  I have had experience with customer service in the retail sector.

#### Self-motivated

Prior to and during Makers I ran my quilting business part-time while homeschooling and taking care of my family. I've taught myself all I've needed to know to run this business successfully for many years. Meeting deadlines, and keeping customers happy has been a big part of that success.

I was able to teach myself enough coding, with no prior knowledge, to allow me to get accepted into Makers Academy. I was able to finish 1 month of pre-course, and 3 months of intensive coursework all while maintaining crazy hours and a busy homelife.

Teaching yourself new things is a sign of self-motivation and my life is filled with self-teaching examples such as photography, Photoshop, drawing, cooking, homeschooling, and various types of crafts.

#### Creative

I am a person who needs creativity as a part of my life.  My interests generally gravitate in that route.  I have dabbled in many things like, Photography, quilting, crafts of all kinds, drawing, composing piano music, and pattern design.  

When I started looking into web development I was very pleased to discover the creative side of tech and how it fits together with the technical aspects.


#### Detail oriented

Pretty much all of the creative interests I have pursued require a great attention to detail.  In particular, I have been known to spend hours (maybe even days) working with Photoshop on a single photo mostly at the pixel level. The time just flies by.

When designing and coding the websites I've created I enjoy working to get them just right. If I don't know how to do something I will search the internet to help problem solve, trying out what I find. It can be a long process at times, but it is worth it.

My attention to detail and ability to be methodical will help me to create beautiful (hopefully bug-free) code.
